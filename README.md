# final_project_CS162
This program will allow users to choose an individual file and hopefully the option for an entire folder/directory to be encrypted/decrypted.
The program will have a GUI and display a "file explorer" that most users are familiar with in their local operating system for them to choose a file.
There will be a button for browsing files and a separate button that can encrypt a file.
No encryption algorithm has been chosen yet. But one will be chosen that can be decrypted by the user.
